Project Title: Movie Recommendation System
Overview:
The Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning project developed to provide personalized movie suggestions to users based on their preferences. With the exponential growth of online movie databases and streaming platforms, users often face difficulty in choosing the next movie to watch. This system solves that problem by leveraging data science techniques to recommend movies that are similar in content to a user’s selected movie.

This project uses Content-Based Filtering, which suggests movies that are similar to the one selected, by analyzing textual metadata such as genre, cast, director, keywords, and overview. It provides a user-friendly interface (optional Streamlit integration) to make the system accessible and interactive.

Objectives:
To build a smart and efficient recommendation system using content-based filtering.

To understand and implement key machine learning concepts such as vectorization and similarity metrics.

To apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text data handling and analysis.

To improve decision-making for users by minimizing the effort needed to find desirable content.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK

Similarity Measurement: Cosine Similarity

Vectorization: CountVectorizer

IDE: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

(Optional) Frontend/UI: Streamlit

Methodology:
Dataset Collection and Cleaning:

Collected movie metadata from open-source datasets (like TMDb).

Merged multiple CSV files to form a comprehensive dataset.

Removed null values, unnecessary columns, and duplicates.

Feature Extraction and Engineering:

Selected important features: title, genres, overview, cast, crew, and keywords.

Extracted the director’s name and top 3 cast members from nested JSON columns.

Combined all relevant textual features into a new column called tags.

Text Preprocessing:

Applied NLP techniques such as:

Lowercasing

Removing punctuation and stopwords

Stemming using PorterStemmer

Ensured consistency across all movie entries.

Vectorization and Similarity Computation:

Converted text into numerical data using CountVectorizer.

Computed a Cosine Similarity matrix to measure how similar each movie is to every other movie.

Stored similarity scores for efficient retrieval.

Recommendation Logic:

When a user inputs a movie title, the system:

Retrieves the corresponding vector from the similarity matrix.

Finds the most similar movies based on cosine similarity scores.

Returns the top N recommendations (usually 5–10 movies).

User Interface (Optional):

Built an interactive interface using Streamlit to:

Accept user input

Display recommendations with movie titles and possibly posters

Challenges Faced:
Cleaning and merging large and inconsistent datasets

Extracting useful data from nested JSON formats

Preventing overfitting in text data (by limiting vocabulary in CountVectorizer)

Dealing with missing or sparse data for certain movies

Results:
The system provided accurate and meaningful recommendations.

Demonstrated an efficient application of content-based filtering using NLP and machine learning techniques.

Could be extended in the future by incorporating collaborative filtering or deep learning models like embeddings for better personalization.

Future Enhancements:
Add collaborative filtering or hybrid systems using user behavior data.

Improve UI/UX with better design and additional filtering options.

Include movie posters, ratings, trailers, or links to streaming platforms for enhanced user experience.

Use TF-IDF vectorizer or word embeddings (like Word2Vec/BERT) for semantic understanding.
